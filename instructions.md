Assignment Instructions:

Create your own page that is capable of receiving three GET parameters:
1) firstname
2) lastname
3) age

Your page should output two sentences:
1) “Hello, my name is [firstname] [lastname].”
2) This statement is conditional based on the [age] parameter.
    “I am [age] years old and... 
    a) if greater than or equal to 18… “I am old enough to vote in the United States.”
    b) if less than 18… “I am not old enough to vote in the United States.”
3) Calculate the days based on the number given for age (3rd sentence)
4) Add the current date to your page with PHP 

You do not need to create a form. You can test your app by appending the GET parameters directly to the URL in your browser address bar.
Use the appropriate built-in PHP functions to clean the input parameters before writing to your page (to prevent XSS attacks)
Output a message if the required parameters are not submitted (see examples).
Avoid errors if the parameters are empty OR do not even exist.
Practice your CSS design skills by trying to emulate or improve upon my example.

Push your PHP file to a GitHub repository
Submit the link to your GitHub repository in Blackboard.
